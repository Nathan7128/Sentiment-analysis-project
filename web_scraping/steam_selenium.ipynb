      "~UNPLAYABLE [FIXED] ON STEAM AS OF THE MOST RECENT UPLAY UPDATE.~Trying to save someone the hassle of buying a currently unusable game. Ubisoft had an update on their UPlay platform that causes steam users to crash consistently at the main menu. You'd hope a company like Ubisoft would be on the problem (or just roll back their trash update) but as it stands, it is unacceptable that they're keeping this title listed. I'll fix my review when they fix the game, because I actually enjoyed playing it while I did.Edit: It's fixed, and while I would recommend this game at a killer discount, I, not even joking, got into the trucking simulator games while this game was unplayable; I haven't looked back, and I would recommend them over The Crew 2 at this point.\n",
      "Titled: 'The crying dollar'Prologue/authors notes:I despise this game with amounts I foresaw humanly impossible. How can this game take the worst f*cking elements of every racing game ever and combine it into one?Graphics: Forza Horizon 2 was better then this ♥♥♥♥.Open world: Is exactly that, 'open', like a damned wasteland in FalloutAI: Rubberbands like it's some alternate NFS Underground era all over again.Quantity over quality: Of course we need 750+ items to grind for.Vehicles:-Airplanes: Them ballers pull 30G and could commit multiple mass crimes before getting destroyed.-Sport Cars: Semi-okay driver assisted land boats.-Dirt bikes: Can accelerate at an angle of 70 degrees?-Rally cars: Hopeless sand boats, the bigger the spoiler the harder the ai slaps. Steering is weird-Drift cars: Just as low grossing as Tokyo Drift in 2006, feels very forced.-Boat races: Handles better then most cars but seems to permanently suffer from 'permanent hurricane' syndrome, in which the speed varies wildly for jackshaft reasons.Upgrades: It doesn't matter which car you choose, it'll all result in the same 'end stage' performance levels. Of course you can't buy them and have to unlock them FOR EVERY SUCKING CAR.Currencies: 'Because we're tighter than bark on a tree'UI: Generic mobile game vibes from this one, nothing makes sense. Everything takes ages to load and there's no good menu's. God forbid you have to reset because the game suddenly decides to utilize it's 4th dimension physics again.If there's one positive to mention then it's the great story, all I vaguely remember is loading screens and 'HOLD ESC FOR 10 MINUTES' to continue. 10/10 would skip again. At least there's no bugs, they prefer to manifest in games that are worthwhile. (I'd be an honor if the player no clipped away while the game tries to save you by crashing, or, if a car gets stuck in a barrier, so you don't have to experience the steering any longer.'Conclusion:Please shut them servers down already, may god let the players see the light, let this abomination die.Yours sincerely,The slapper\n",

      "As one of the many that picked this up when it was reduced to 84p recently, I have to say I'm really enjoying this. I've not even done much of the events or races either. I've been enjoying a chilled-out driving experience just by working my way through the various 'stories'; little narrative adventures which involve a little detective work to identify a place on the map then (usually) road-tripping it to that spot before being given the next. It's been an enjoyable way to explore the ambitious map (gaining some new vehicles and extras as  rewards) which offers a truncated vision of the US. It's really huge and seems to cover all the main cities plus a whole load of smaller ones with the appropriate land-masses in-between. Snow capped mountains, glacier lakes, dense woodlands, arable farmlands and rocky canyons are all there, among with many, many miles of asphalt and off-road tracks. At certain times it's a gorgeous sight to behold depending on the weather and particular lighting at the time. There's bright summers, hazy fog, downpours and snowy scenes etc and a shifting day to night cycle. The included photo mode is a lovely way to capture these moments and I've found taking part in the photo events a pleasant experience alongside documenting my road trips.Credit to Ubi for the sheer wealth of variety in the game which gives you so much to play around with - Street Racing, Rally Cross, Motor Cross, Drag Racing, F1, Hyper Car Racing, Powerboats, Monster Trucks, Demolition Derbies, Planes and Motorbikes are all catered for. There's even some hovercraft events. In this sense it's the perfect extension of Ubisoft's 'map of much busywork' approach that we've seen already in their other games, but here it feels more at home. There's sure to be something to take your fancy and it's great to have so much choice. I just like bombing through the woods on a dirt bike with the bumper cam enabled as it really is quite a thrill ride. It's simply a wonderful, massive playground, even if you ignore the events for a while. In free roam, you can freely switch between 3 vehicles on the fly and it's a lot of fun being able to fly around in a plane then swap to boat or land vehicle and drop out of the sky to hit the land or water running.It runs smoothly (60fps/1440p) on my ageing hardware (i7-4790, GTX1660 Super, 16GB RAM), although there are times when connections to the server can prevent the game starting. Like many I had a problem initially where the game wouldn't start up fully after the main menu. This was due to some issue with connected accounts in my Ubisoft account. I found disconnecting both the Amazon and Stadia accounts via the Ubisoft website (not via Ubisoft Connect) seemed to solve that.Despite all the variety, I do wish the car handling model was a little more nuanced and tactile. It's very arcadey (which is fine) but I would have loved it if you felt the weight transfer more as the cars move around, and it makes me think fondly of the 'feel' in other games, even older ones like the first Racedriver Grid game where you 'felt' the cars and traction of them much more intuitively.That said, I certainly can't grumble with the entertainment I've had thus far and I've still got a whole ton of events to get stuck into and a whole bunch of vehicles to get (there's loads). Even though I got it really cheap I'd say it still represents good value at current sale prices (80% off).\n",

      "Many people say that this game is bad, assuming that it is because of the horrible graphics you will always notice. Personally, this is one of the games that I would recommend to give some time to spend on because it is fun and the player has freedom to cruise around and do numerous activities whether you play by yourself or with a built crew.With the ability to switch to another vehicle whether air or water while driving, you get to realize that there are so many things that this game offers. For me, this is an awesome game, though the sole issue I have with this game is that it is only playable ONLINE. I wish there is a feature where in you can drive around and participate in races even without the online feature or just disabled online mode. In addition to the free-roaming, there are races that provide the player a huge drop of cash and with the ability to increase the number of drop of car parts and money by progressing your ICON stats, you are guaranteed wealthy enough to purchase numerous vehicles of different disciplines that are so many that I am speechless of this game and how amazing it is.To conclude. The Crew 2 is fun. Surely some will say the graphic renditions, especially buildings and environments have awful sight to it, but still, with all honesty, this is a fun game to play.

      "Perfect combination of NFS and Forza, in my opinion crew 2 is even better than MotorFest as the Crew MotorFest tries too hard to be Forza while Crew 2 feels unique. Bought it for less than 1 USD so i say its worth it in everyway, i usually don't like Forza and play NFS titles but with the sh*t show that is NFS Unbound, Crew 2 filled the spot as the ultimate game for my arcade racing cravings, 250 hours well spent.\n",
      "I spent more time trying to get the game to launch between having to deal with ubisoft launcher and BattlEye complaining about my computer's driver configuration than I spent playing it.  Spent even more time getting it set up on my laptop and the game is awful, barely playable.  I don't even honestly care about the $1 I want to return this game on principal, it's completely useless and Ubisoft should know that I don't even want their AAA game for $1, the $1 is worth more.  Save yourself the time and energy and go play almost ANY other racing game, this one isn't it.  Not to mention Ubisoft will probably drop server support for it in a couple years anyways and leave the customers high and dry, just like they did with The Crew 1.\n",
      "Fun game. The vehicle collection is very good with a ton of different vehicles. The map is enormous and that's a good and a bad thing in my opinion. The good thing is that there is always something new to discover. But the bad part about the size for me is that I always fast travel to events because it takes forever to get to them and in other games I most of the time drive to the events and get to know the map more. There are so many events in the game so there is always something to do which is great. I would like the game to be a little less grindy. you need to play the game a lot to get money to buy vehicles. But other than that it's great.\n",

It just doesnt hold a flame to The Crew.With that said I cannot justify NOT recommending this game. It is still in its own little category. Yes there are better games like FH5...but FH hits a content (variety of stuff to do) wall and loses its adventurous fun pretty quick. You cant do canyon runs on bikes or in planes. You can't get a group together and ride motorcycles across the country...you cant be stopped by cops let alone play as them. Get this game-drive around and explore as much as you can before your 2hr window is up and make the decision yourself.\n",

      "The Crew 2: A Glitchy Road Trip Worth the PriceIt is one wild ride—sometimes amazing, sometimes frustrating enough to make you question life choices.The Grind is RealIf you’re into second jobs, this game is perfect. Earning decent cars and upgrades feels like running on a treadmill that never stops. Sure, the variety of vehicles is great, but be prepared to grind endlessly for anything remotely cool.Graphics: Good, But Hold My BeerThe game has moments where it looks incredible, but those are quickly overshadowed by bugs. Cars and trucks on the road seem to be auditioning for a Transformers reboot, morphing randomly. The traffic doesn’t just spawn; it appears out of nowhere, almost like it’s actively trying to ruin your race. Render distance? Let’s just say objects pop into existence so dramatically you’d think they were trying to surprise you.Frame-Locked at 60Oh, and here’s a fun twist: the game locks you at 60 FPS. Yep, even if you’ve spent thousands on your rig. Your GPU? Barely breaking a sweat. Your CPU? Taking a nap. But the game? Nope, it insists on keeping things chill at 60.What Actually Works?Despite the grind and glitches, there’s something undeniably fun about cruising around an open world that feels alive (bugs aside). You can drive, fly, or boat your way across a gigantic map, and when the game isn’t tripping over itself, it’s a blast.Final VerdictIf you got this game for cheap, you won’t regret it. The fun outweighs the flaws, as long as you don’t take it too seriously. It’s like a clumsy eagle: sure, it’s awkward and unpredictable, but it still soars when it matters.It’s a good game. 🦅 Eagle screech 🦅\n",

I purchased on a Steam sale for $9.99 and after playing for 16 hours, I can honestly say that if I had paid full price for this game, I'd still be satisfied. This is a very entertaining game, it's kept me busy for hours already!!The format of the game seems to take a little getting used to, at least for me, having never played Crew (1). That said its as intuitive as any other game... sort of ...but when I couldn't figure something out I always seemed to have fun with whatever it was that I was in.I'm a simulator game liker, playing ATS, ETS2, Rimz Racing, Assetto Corsa, FS17-22 and I found this game to be realistic enough to keep me entertained. There are some things about it that make it a little \"whaaaaat?\" but that's what makes this game that much more fun. It's not as uptight as some of the other racing games, yet still offering an absolutely massive open world to roam about in with challenging races along the way.I'd recommend this game hands down. I am pleasantly surprised by the graphics, the game play, the physics and even the sound effects.

      "The worst racing game I have ever tried to play. I spent about an hour trying to set up the steering wheel with the gearbox, and nothing worked. The car physics in this game are worse than in NFS, and the graphics are a completely separate issue no matter how much you tweak them, even at maximum settings, it looks like a cheap low-quality 2015 Middle East mobile game. It’s not even worth 200 tenge with the discount I bought it for (that’s a little less than one dollar). I feel sorry for those who bought the game at full price. From the very beginning, there were problems entering the game you have to do so much just to get in. It’s terrible. As a result, in an hour of play, I lost an hour of time and nerves that can’t be restored. My rating for the game: -100/10 Ubisoft: -1 000 000 aura\n",

      "This is supposed to be a simulation; I crash into a tree at 400 km/h and 5 leaves fall from the tree, yet my car is in better aesthetic condition than before the crash, and even the dirt falls off. Realistic game.\n",
      "It's the most annoying racing game I played.Pro's: beatiful landscapes, big map, nice graphics♥♥♥'s: everything else. You cannot jump from activity to activity, there's always some stupid unskippable animation you need to watch through. Want to open the map? Let's zoom out for a couple of seconds. Want to start new trial? Please wait for us to speak to you for a bit, then please drive to starting location couple of feets, then wait again, then watch stupid animation and then may be activity will start. Camera is another point of major frustration for me: it always auto-centers, always, you cannot look to the sides or beside you, only fixed front position, no fun allowed in Ubisoft game. Sound design is god awful. While engines sound nice and music is alright, everything else is a major letdown. I cannot understand why every minor or major collision sounds like either bottles of milk banging each other or like someone is crashed into cart full of scrap metal. You can not even use nitro without gag reflex, start of the nitro sounds like farts, no joke. Who made this? Why?\n",

Good game if you want a big map that compromises details... or maybe if you want a good experience too but vice versa, The Crew Motorfest is not bad, its just more \"grindier\" than the crew 2 IMO.\n",

Even the new \"The Crew MotorFest\" I got through the first races and the moment I needed to pick my first car in the game.

Physics are bad, controls are even worse. It's a bit P2W, it's childish, has bad sound effects and music, bad animations, and it's just boring. It had potential but some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it, it's laggy, even though i have a pretty good PC. Honestly it just look like asphalt 9 to me. Not worth the money i spent.\n",

      "The Crew 2 is a captivating open-world racing game that offers a thrilling and visually stunning experience. While it may suffer from some repetitive elements and technical issues, its vast open world, diverse vehicle roster, and stunning visuals make it a must-play for racing enthusiasts.\n",
      "good game\n",
      "Good experience for a racing game....\n",
      "The graphics are stunning, with beautifully rendered environments. The map feels alive with full of NPCs and impressively large as hell, the ♥♥♥♥♥ entire USA. It's genuinely fun to explore.The choice of cars is extensive. Unlike many racing games, The Crew 2 allows you to switch between land, water, and air vehicles. The snapshot function is incredibly advanced compared to other racing games. I made a lot of cinematic shots with that.The gameplay can feel repetitive and uninspiring if you don’t enjoy playing solo. As we all know, the Ubisoft is going to close down all servers, so it'll not multiplayer modes.The soundtrack is unfortunately a weak point. Music plays a key role in enhancing the energy of racing games, but The Crew 2 failed at that.Additionally, the controls feel odd, and the vehicles classification might be frustrating for some players. Not all cars are capable of drifting, so if you're someone who loves  drifting, you'll have to purchase specific drift cars.For those players who love open-world exploration and a vast collection of vehicles, The Crew 2 offers an enjoyable experience. But for those looking for racing mechanics and serious multiplayer action, it might not fully satisfy.Overall It’s a solid game worth trying, if it's on sale. But it's kinda questionable at full price. 7/10 for me.\n",
